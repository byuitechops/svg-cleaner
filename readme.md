# SVG-Cleaner

## Description 
This tool removes title attributes from links inside SVG code. It also sets all links to open in a new tab. I can't remember who it was made for, but They should be using the version on the github page for this repo, so don't remove it!

## How to Use
Click on [this link](https://byuitechops.github.io/svg-cleaner/) and copy the svg code you want cleaned into the appropriate box. The cleaned code will then appear in the 'Cleaned SVG Code' box.
